    <h1>⚡ Flashbyte</h1>
    <h3>A Simple, local and fast file sharing app.</h3>
</div>


### Seemless and smooth file sharing experience
- All file types supported!
- No file size limit!
- Does not use an external server (No internet required!!)
- Transfer files to any device on your local network.
- Open source & no data is collected!


### How does this work?
Flashbyte uses pure TCP sockets to establish a connection between two devices on a local network inside an isolate (isolated memory channel) which is then utilized to read and send over the file bytes whilst keeping the frontend (main UI isolate) smooth.

You can try out Flashbyte on the following platforms:
